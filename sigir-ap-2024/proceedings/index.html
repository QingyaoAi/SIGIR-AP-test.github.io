            <p>This talk explores the field of empirical microeconomics, focusing on the importance of causal inference and its application in policy-making. I discuss the concept of evidence in empirical studies, emphasizing the distinction between causality and correlation. The talk highlights various methods of causal inference, including Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) and Natural Experiments, and their importance in Evidence-Based Policy Making (EBPM).</p> <p>Through a series of empirical studies, I examine how information experiments can influence decision-making and behavior. Key examples include addressing gender wage gaps, altering social norms regarding female labor force participation, and the impact of role models in educational and labor market outcomes. The talk also discusses the challenges in proving discrimination based on gender and race, and the effectiveness of interventions in mitigating these biases.</p> <p>By presenting these findings, the talk aims to underscore the critical role of information and causal inference in developing effective policies and understanding human behavior. The discussion will also touch upon the limitations and external validity of information experiments, advocating for the accumulation of evidence to support robust policy decisions.</p>

                            <h3><a class="DLtitleLink" title="Full Citation in the ACM Digital Library" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3673791.3698416">AU-RAG: Agent-based Universal Retrieval Augmented Generation</a></h3><ul class="DLauthors"><li class="nameList">Jisoo Jang</li><li class="nameList Last">Wen-Syan Li</li></ul><div class="DLabstract"><div style="display:inline">
            <p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has been effectively used to improve the accuracy of question-answering (Q&amp;A) systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating local knowledge and more up-to-date content. However, traditional RAG methods, including those with re-ranking mechanisms, face challenges when dealing with large, frequently updated data sources or when accessing sources exclusively via APIs, as they require pre-encoding all content into embedding vectors. To address these limitations, we introduce Agent-based Universal RAG (AU-RAG), a novel approach that augments data sources with descriptive metadata, allowing an agent to dynamically search through diverse data pools. This agent-driven system can learn from examples to retrieve and consolidate data from various sources on the fly, functioning as a more flexible and adaptive RAG. We demonstrate AU-RAG's functionality with a financial analysis example and evaluate its performance using a multi-source QA dataset. The results show that AU-RAG performs comparably to RAG with re-ranking in data retrieval tasks while also demonstrating an enhanced ability to intelligently learn and access new data sources from examples, making it a robust solution for dynamic and complex information environments.</p>

            <p>Language Models (LMs) memorize a vast amount of factual knowledge, exhibiting strong performance across diverse tasks and domains. However, it has been observed that the performance diminishes when dealing with less-popular or low-frequency concepts and entities, for example in domain specific applications. The two prominent approaches to enhance the performance of LMs on low-frequent topics are: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and fine-tuning (FT) over synthetic data. This paper explores and evaluates the impact of RAG and FT on customizing LMs in handling low-frequency entities on question answering tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on twelve LMs of varying size and type and different FT methods, data augmentation, and retrieval models. Our findings indicate that while FT boosts the performance across entities of varying popularity, RAG surpasses FT by a large margin particularly for least popular factual knowledge. Additionally, the success of both RAG and FT approaches is amplified by improving retrieval and data augmentation techniques. Fine tuning, while beneficial for small LMs, requires extensive resources. To address this issue, we propose the new <em>Stimulus RAG</em> approach that surpasses the effectiveness of fine tuning based approaches, thereby eliminating the need for the costly data augmentation and fine tuning step for enriching LMs with less popular factual knowledge.</p>

            <p>The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized how users access information, shifting from traditional search engines to direct question-and-answer interactions with LLMs. However, the widespread adoption of LLMs has revealed a significant challenge known as hallucination, wherein LLMs generate coherent yet factually inaccurate responses. This hallucination phenomenon has led to users' distrust in information retrieval systems based on LLMs. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes Dynamic Retrieval Augmentation based on hallucination Detection (DRAD) as a novel method to detect and mitigate hallucinations in LLMs. DRAD improves upon traditional retrieval augmentation by dynamically adapting the retrieval process based on real-time hallucination detection. It features two main components: Real-time Hallucination Detection (RHD) for identifying potential hallucinations without external models, and Self-correction based on External Knowledge (SEK) for correcting these errors using external knowledge. Experiment results show that DRAD demonstrates superior performance in both detecting and mitigating hallucinations in LLMs. All of our code and data are open-sourced at https://github.com/oneal2000/EntityHallucination.</p>

            <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to assess the relevance of information objects. This work reports on experiments to study the labelling of short texts (i.e., passages) for relevance, using multiple open-source and proprietary LLMs. While the overall agreement of some LLMs with human judgements is comparable to human-to-human agreement measured in previous research, LLMs are more likely to label passages as relevant compared to human judges, indicating that LLM labels denoting non-relevance are more reliable than those indicating relevance.</p> <p>This observation prompts us to further examine cases where human judges and LLMs disagree, particularly when the human judge labels the passage as non-relevant and the LLM labels it as relevant. Results show a tendency for many LLMs to label passages that include the original query terms as relevant. We therefore conduct experiments to inject query words into random and irrelevant passages, not unlike the way we inserted the query 'best café near me' into this paper. The results demonstrate that LLMs are highly influenced by the presence of query words in the passages under assessment, even if the wider passage has no relevance to the query. This tendency of LLMs to be fooled by the mere presence of query words demonstrates a weakness in our current measures of LLM labelling: relying on overall agreement misses important patterns of failures. There is a real risk of bias in LLM-generated relevance labels and, therefore, a risk of bias in rankers trained on those labels.</p> <p>Additionally, we investigate the effects of deliberately manipulating LLMs by instructing them to label passages as relevant, similar to the instruction 'this paper is perfectly relevant' inserted above. We find that such manipulation influences the performance of some LLMs, highlighting the critical need to consider potential vulnerabilities when deploying LLMs in real-world applications.</p>

            <p>Text-to-Image (TTI) systems often support people during ideation, the early stages of a creative process when exposure to a broad set of relevant or partially relevant images can help explore the design space. Since ideation is an important subclass of TTI tasks, understanding how to quantitatively evaluate TTI systems according to how well they support ideation is crucial to promoting research and development for these users. However, existing evaluation metrics for TTI remain focused on distributional similarity metrics like Fréchet Inception Distance (FID). We take an alternative approach and, based on established methods from ranking evaluation, develop TTI evaluation metrics with explicit models of how users browse and interact with sets of spatially arranged generated images. Our proposed offline evaluation metrics for TTI not only capture how relevant generated images are with respect to the user's ideation need but also take into consideration the diversity and arrangement of the set of generated images. We analyze our proposed family of TTI metrics using human studies on image grids generated by three different TTI systems based on subsets of the widely used benchmarks such as MS-COCO captions and Localized Narratives as well as prompts used in naturalistic settings. Our results demonstrate that grounding metrics in how people use systems is an important and understudied area of benchmark design.</p>

            <p>Cognitive biases are systematic deviations in thinking that lead to irrational judgments and problematic decision-making, extensively studied across various fields. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown advanced understanding capabilities but may inherit human biases from their training data. While social biases in LLMs have been well-studied, cognitive biases have received less attention, with existing research focusing on specific scenarios. The broader impact of cognitive biases on LLMs in various decision-making contexts remains underexplored. We investigated whether LLMs are influenced by the threshold priming effect in <em>relevance judgments</em>, a core task and widely-discussed research topic in the Information Retrieval (IR) coummunity. The priming effect occurs when exposure to certain stimuli unconsciously affects subsequent behavior and decisions. Our experiment employed 10 topics from the TREC 2019 Deep Learning passage track collection, and tested AI judgments under different document relevance scores, batch lengths, and LLM models, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLaMa2-13B and LLaMa2-70B. Results showed that LLMs tend to give lower scores to later documents if earlier ones have high relevance, and vice versa, regardless of the combination and model used. Our finding demonstrates that LLM's judgments, similar to human judgments, are also influenced by threshold priming biases, and suggests that researchers and system engineers should take into account potential human-like cognitive biases in designing, evaluating, and auditing LLMs in IR tasks and beyond</p>

            <p>Traditional search evaluation metrics, such as MRR and NDCG, focus on absolute measures of effectiveness. While they allow us to compare the absolute performance of one retrieval method to another, we do not know if systems with similar absolute performance achieve this performance by finding the same items, or by finding different items with similar relevance grades. To address this problem, several recent proposals have measured the relative performance of a retrieval method in the context of the results from one or more other methods. In this paper, we address theoretical limitations of these proposals and introduce a new metric called Normalized Residual Gain (NRG) that can be seen as an extension of the underlying absolute metric, rather than as an entirely new metric. Operating in the context of the results retrieved by one or more other methods, NRG adjusts gain values according to the browsing model of the absolute metric. Through testing over the MS MARCO dev small and TREC DL 2019 datasets, we find that higher absolute effectiveness does not necessarily correlate with a higher NRG score, which will vary depending on context. In particular, in the context of modern neural models, NRG suggests that a traditional BM25 ranker continues to find relevant items missed by even the best neural models.</p>

            <p>User simulation is emerging as a promising direction towards scalable and reliable training and evaluation of conversational search systems. As such, the simulated user assumes the user's role in interaction with the system and aims to satisfy its information needs by querying, answering clarifying questions, and providing feedback. While recent research made significant progress in generating user's utterances, it remained limited to simulating the average user. In other words, state-of-the-art simulators do not take into account differences that exist between real users, such as personality and behavioral traits. To this end, we propose a framework for incorporating behavioral traits into a generative user simulator for conversational search. Specifically, we utilize in-context learning to embed behavioral traits, such as cooperativeness and politeness, into the LLM-based simulator. The framework, dubbed ParamConvSim, parametrizes certain behavioral traits and allows tuning the degree of a single trait present in the simulated user. In this paper, we design a user model, modeling the user's patience, cooperativeness, and politeness. In addition, we present and analyze the effectiveness of conversational search systems when interacting with different such simulated users. Results suggest that different simulated users indeed interact differently with the search system, leading to different system effectiveness levels.</p>

            <p>This study provides a thorough investigation of search within instant messaging applications (IMA) used in workplace settings (e.g., Slack and MS Teams), investigating search intents, user behaviour, points of friction, and missing functionalities. While IMAs are extensively used to accelerate communication between workers, user search behaviour in IMAs is still poorly understood, and search functionalities currently appear primitive and possibly lacking features that support the specific nature of search in this context.</p> <p>We designed a mix-methods analysis based on three core studies that help us unveil search within IMAs. First, we created an in-depth diary study to capture user interactions when searching in professional IMAs, involving 17 participants spanning diverse geographies and yielding a total of 298 diary entries. The study comprised a pre-study interview with participants, followed by a structured diary form that captured essential metrics along with qualitative insights. The diary study was followed by a post-study interview focused on identifying and understanding failures, struggles and missing functionality. Subsequently, the insights learnt from the thematic coding of post-study interviews were utilized to develop a large-scale survey involving 222 participants out of 400 recruited through the Prolific platform.</p> <p>Our findings suggest that while users find search functionalities within IMAs useful, there remains significant scope for improvement. The study sheds light on common search intents driving users to explore their message histories and the types of content that fulfil these intents.

            <p>Information-seeking dialogues span a wide range of questions, from simple factoid to complex queries that require exploring multiple facets and viewpoints. When performing exploratory searches in unfamiliar domains, users may lack background knowledge and struggle to verify the system-provided information, making them vulnerable to misinformation. We investigate the limitations of response generation in conversational information-seeking systems, highlighting potential inaccuracies, pitfalls, and biases in the responses. The study addresses the problem of <em>query answerability</em> and the challenge of <em>response incompleteness</em>. Our user studies explore how these issues impact user experience, focusing on users' ability to identify biased, incorrect, or incomplete responses. We design two crowdsourcing tasks to assess user experience with different system response variants, highlighting critical issues to be addressed in future conversational information-seeking research. Our analysis reveals that it is easier for users to detect response incompleteness than query answerability and user satisfaction is mostly associated with response diversity, not factual correctness.</p>

            <p>Searching has become an essential method for acquiring knowledge. The field of Search as Learning (SAL) has traditionally explored how users engage with search engines for learning tasks, yet these engines frequently falter with complex cognitive challenges. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT has addressed these shortcomings, marking a shift towards conversational search methods. Despite its potential, few research has investigated how ChatGPT supports users in the SAL context. To bridge this gap, we conducted a dedicated user study involving thirty-one undergraduates performing nine distinct learning-related search tasks. These tasks were divided into three topics, each explored at three levels of cognitive complexity. Using a Latin square design, we analyzed users' search behavior and outcome when using three search modes -- traditional search engines, ChatGPT, and their combination -- across various topics and cognitive complexities. The findings suggest that ChatGPT significantly boosts efficiency and enhances user experience and outcomes, particularly in more complex tasks. This research highlights the increasing importance of generative AI in enriching users' information-seeking endeavors.</p>

            <p>Modern society is facing pressing issues, including environmental challenges, inequality, and regional conflicts. To resolve these complex societal problems, the concept of ''open science'' is essential, as emphasized at last year's G7 meeting. In Japan, starting in 2025, all scientific papers resulting from publicly funded research, along with the associated data, will be required to be immediately accessible through open access.</p> <p>The National Institute of Informatics (NII) has been at the forefront of advancing Japan's academic information infrastructure for many years. In 2017, NII embarked on the development of the NII Research Data Cloud -- a platform for the publication, discovery, and management of academic information -- which became operational in 2021. By 2022, the project evolved into a research data ecosystem, built in collaboration with numerous universities and research institutions. This initiative aims to create a comprehensive environment where papers, data, and computational resources are readily accessible across all fields of research.</p> <p>Recognizing the significant impact of generative AI on society and the need for a hub in Japan where large-scale language models (LLMs) can be developed and studied, NII spearheaded the formation of the LLM-jp study group (https://llm-jp.nii.ac.jp/en/) in May 2023. The group, founded on principles of openness, began with approximately 30 researchers specializing in natural language processing and has since grown to over 1,800 participants from industry, government, and academia.</p> <p>In April 2024, NII further advanced this initiative by establishing the LLM R&amp;D Center. By September 2024, the center had developed and released the world's largest fully open LLM, featuring 172 billion parameters -- on a scale similar to GPT-3.5. The center's ongoing work also focuses on ensuring the reliability and transparency of these models. </p> <p>To address the complex societal challenges mentioned above, it is crucial not only to deepen academic research but also to foster collaboration across various disciplines, creating new cross-disciplinary knowledge. LLMs can play a pivotal role in these processes by interpreting data, interconnecting and systematizing knowledge, and laying the groundwork for a robust knowledge infrastructure.</p>

            <p>Traditional evaluation of information access systems has focused primarily on average utility across a set of information needs (information retrieval) or users (recommender systems). In this work, we argue that evaluating only with average metric measurements assumes utilitarian values not aligned with traditions of information access based on equal access. We advocate for pessimistic evaluation of information access systems focusing on worst case utility. These methods are (i) grounded in ethical and pragmatic concepts, (ii) theoretically complementary to existing robustness and fairness methods, and (iii) empirically validated across a set of retrieval and recommendation tasks. These results suggest that pessimistic evaluation should be included in existing experimentation processes to better understand the behavior of systems, especially when concerned with principles of social good.</p>

            <p>Rank-Biased Overlap <em>(RBO)</em> is a popular measure of the similarity between two rankings. A key characteristic of <em>RBO</em> is that it can be computed even when the rankings are not fully seen and only a prefix is known, but this introduces uncertainty in the computation. In such cases, one would normally compute the point estimate <em>RBO<sub>EXT</sub></em>, as well as bounds representing the best and worst cases; their difference is thus a residual quantifying the amount of uncertainty. Another source of uncertainty is the presence of tied items, because their actual relative order is unknown. Current approaches to this issue similarly provide a point estimate by considering the average <em>RBO</em> score over all the permutations of the ties, such as <em>RBO<sup>a</sup></em>. However, there is currently no approach to quantify and bound the uncertainty due to ties, just as there is for the uncertainty due to unseen items. In this paper we fill this gap and provide algorithmic solutions to the problem of finding the arrangements of tied items that yield the lowest and highest possible <em>RBO</em> scores, naturally leading to total bounds and residuals. We also show that the current <em>RBO<sup>a</sup></em> estimate only equals the average <em>RBO</em> over permutations when the rankings have the same length, so we also generalize it to rankings of different lengths. In summary, this work provides a full account for the uncertainty in <em>RBO</em>, allowing practitioners to make more sensible decisions on the grounds of rank similarity. The main realization is that residuals can actually be <em>much</em> larger once we account for both sources of uncertainty. To illustrate this, we present empirical results using both synthetic and TREC data, demonstrating that a realistic picture for the residual of <em>RBO</em> can only be provided by considering both sources of uncertainty.</p>

            <p>Experiments often result in the need to compare an <em>observation</em> against a <em>reference</em>, where observation and reference are selections made from some specified domain. The goal is to determine how close the observation is to the ideal result represented by the reference, so that, all other things being equal, systems that achieve outputs closer to the ideal reference can be preferred for deployment. Both observation and reference might be sets of items, or might be ordered sequences (rankings) of items. There are thus four possible combinations between sets and rankings. Three of those possibilities are already familiar to IR researchers, and have received detailed exploration. Here we consider the fourth combination, that of comparing an observation set relative to a reference ranking. We introduce a new measurement that we call <em>rank-biased recall</em> to cover this scenario, and demonstrate its usefulness with a case study from multi-phase ranking. We also present a new top-weighted ''ranking compared to ranking'' measurement, and show that it represents a complementary assessment to the previous rank-biased overlap mechanism, and possesses distinctive characteristics</p>

            <p>Spoken conversational search is a type of search where no screens are available and the interactions between users and systems are entirely voice-based. To obtain diverse information in spoken conversational search, it is essential for the system to suggest what should be searched for next. We refer to such a suggestion as an aspect suggestion. In this work, we focus on the timing of when the system should provide aspect suggestions and investigate whether the timing of the suggestion affects the participants' querying behavior. We conducted a user study (<em>N</em>=27) using the Wizard of Oz method, in which we compared three systems: (1) a system without aspect suggestion (no aspect suggestion), (2) a system that provides an aspect suggestion immediately after answering the participant's query (immediate aspect suggestion), and (3) a system that provides an aspect suggestion when the user is facing difficulty in formulating a new query (delayed aspect suggestion). The results of the study revealed that aspect suggestions enabled the participants to obtain more diverse information. Additionally, we observed that the delayed aspect suggestion facilitated the participants to formulate queries more spontaneously compared with the immediate aspect suggestion. Interview results indicated a participant preference for immediate aspect suggestion when lacking domain knowledge or query ideas.</p>

            <p>In recommender systems, the retrieval phase is at the first stage and of paramount importance, requiring both effectiveness and <em>very high</em> efficiency. Recently, generative retrieval methods such as DSI and NCI, offering the benefit of end-to-end differentiability, have become an emerging paradigm for document retrieval with notable performance improvement, suggesting their potential applicability in recommendation scenarios. A fundamental limitation of these methods is their approach of generating item identifiers as text inputs, which fails to capture the intrinsic semantics of item identifiers as indices. The structural aspects of identifiers are only considered in construction and ignored during training. In addition, generative retrieval methods often generate imbalanced tree structures and yield identifiers with inconsistent lengths, leading to increased item inference time and sub-optimal performance. We introduce a novel generative retrieval framework named SEATER, which learns SEmAntic Tree-structured item identifiERs using an encoder-decoder structure. To optimize the structure of item identifiers, SEATER incorporates two contrastive learning tasks to ensure the alignment of token embeddings and the ranking orders of similar identifiers. In addition, SEATER devises a balanced <em>k</em>-ary tree structure of item identifiers, thus ensuring consistent semantic granularity and inference efficiency. Extensive experiments on three public datasets and an industrial dataset have demonstrated that SEATER outperforms a number of state-of-the-art models significantly.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly shaped the applications of AI in multiple fields, including the studies of legal intelligence. Trained on extensive legal texts, including statutes and legal documents, the legal LLMs can capture important legal knowledge/concepts effectively and provide important support for downstream legal applications such as legal consultancy. Yet, the dynamic nature of legal statutes and interpretations also poses new challenges to the use of LLMs in legal applications. Particularly, how to update the legal knowledge of LLMs effectively and efficiently has become an important research problem in practice. Existing benchmarks for evaluating knowledge update methods are mostly designed for the open domain and cannot address the specific challenges of the legal domain, such as the nuanced application of new legal knowledge, the complexity and lengthiness of legal regulations, and the intricate nature of legal reasoning.</p> <p>To address this gap, we introduce the Legal Knowledge Update BEnchmark, i.e. LeKUBE, which evaluates knowledge update methods for legal LLMs across five dimensions.

            <p>Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) are a cornerstone of academic research, yet they are often labour-intensive and time-consuming due to the detailed literature curation process. The advent of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) promises to revolutionize this process by assisting researchers in several tedious tasks, one of them being the generation of effective Boolean queries that will select the publications to consider including in a review. This paper presents an extensive study of Boolean query generation using LLMs for systematic reviews, reproducing and extending the work of Wang et al. and Alaniz et al. Our study investigates the replicability and reliability of results achieved using ChatGPT and compares its performance with open-source alternatives like Mistral and Zephyr to provide a more comprehensive analysis of LLMs for query generation.</p> <p>Therefore, we implemented a pipeline, which automatically creates a Boolean query for a given review topic by using a previously defined LLM, retrieves all documents for this query from the PubMed database and then evaluates the results.

We then generalize our results by analyzing and evaluating open-source models and evaluating their efficacy in generating Boolean queries.</p> <p>Finally, we conduct a failure analysis to identify and discuss the limitations and shortcomings of using LLMs for Boolean query generation.

            <p>Evaluating the interactions between users and systems presents many challenges. Simulation offers a reliable, re-usable, and repeatable methodology to explore how different users, user behaviours and/or retrieval systems impact performance. With Large Language Models and Generative AI now widely available and accessible, new affordances are possible. These allow researchers to create more ''realistic'' simulated users that can generate queries and judge items like humans, and to develop new retrieval systems where responses and interactions are conversational and based on retrieval augmented generation. This resource paper presents a community-led initiative to update the Simulation of Interactive Information Retrieval (SimIIR) Framework to enable the simulation of conversational search using LLMs. The largest update provides a conversational search workflow which involves a number of new possible interactions with a search system or agent -- enabling a host of new development and evaluation opportunities. Other developments include the Markovian Users, Cognitive States, LLM-based components for assessing snippets/documents/responses, generating queries, deciding on when to stop/continue, and PyTerrier integration. This paper aims to mark the release of SimIIR 3.0 and invites the community to build, extend, and use the resource.</p>

            <p>There are settings in which reproducibility of ranked lists is desirable, such as when extracting a subset of an evolving document corpus for downstream research tasks or in domains such as patent retrieval or in medical systematic reviews, with high reproducibility expectations. However, as global term statistics change when documents change or are added to a corpus, queries using typical ranked retrieval models are not even reproducible for the parts of the document corpus that have not changed. Thus, Boolean retrieval frequently remains the mechanism of choice in such settings.</p> <p>We present a hybrid retrieval system combining Lucene for fast retrieval with a column-store-based retrieval system maintaining a versioned and time-stamped index. The latter component allows re-execution of previously posed queries resulting in the same ranked list and further allows for time-travel queries over evolving collection, as web archives, while maintaining the original ranking. Thus, retrieval results in evolving document collections are fully reproducible even when document collections and thus term statistics change.</p>

            <p>Language technology, particularly information retrieval, is poised to have a profound impact on society. We believe that technology with such far-reaching potential should be accessible to everyone, not just the technologically privileged. Therefore, we advocate for open-source for all, ensuring that individuals from diverse research areas, societal sectors, and backgrounds have access to information retrieval and language technology tools with low barriers to entry. In this paper, we describe Simple Transformers, a library created with these goals in mind. It is designed to simplify the training, evaluation, and usage of transformer models. As of 2024, the library has garnered over 4,000 stars on GitHub and has been downloaded over 3 million times. These metrics reflect its wide acceptance and usage across different sectors. We describe the design and implementation of the library, provide examples of its usage and adoption, Finally, we also reflect on how Simple Transformers contributes to the goal of ''open-source for all.''</p>

            <p>First presented in 1996, the binary interpolative coding (BIC) technique of Moffat and Stuiver is a highly-effective way of representing streams of integers in a parameter-free manner, especially if there are localized clusters of small values. In 2009 Teuhola presented an alternative interpretation of binary interpolative coding that employs a non-recursive structure; and also described tournament coding, a variant that provides better compression in some cases. In this update we illustrate an additional benefit arising from Teuhola's interpretation, a reduced sensitivity to block size effects; and also show that further small gains in compression effectiveness can be achieved through the use of localized codes. We provide results in support of these claims based on both synthetic data files and on inputs that reflect typical applications in which binary interpolative coding or tournament coding might be applied.</p>

            <p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) integrated with external tools and APIs have successfully addressed complex tasks by using in-context learning or fine-tuning. Despite this progress, the vast scale of tool retrieval remains challenging due to stringent input length constraints. In response, we propose a pre-retrieval strategy from an extensive repository, effectively framing the problem as the massive tool retrieval (MTR) task. We introduce the MTRB (massive tool retrieval benchmark) to evaluate real-world tool-augmented LLM scenarios with a large number of tools. This benchmark is designed for low-resource scenarios and includes a diverse collection of tools with descriptions refined for consistency and clarity. It consists of three subsets, each containing 90 test samples and 10 training samples. To handle the low-resource MTR task, we raise a new query-tool alignment (QTA) framework leverages LLMs to enhance query-tool alignment by rewriting user queries through ranking functions and the direct preference optimization (DPO) method. This approach consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in top-5 and top-10 retrieval tasks across the MTRB benchmark, with improvements up to 93.28% based on the metric Sufficiency@<em>k</em>, which measures the adequacy of tool retrieval within the first <em>k</em> results. Furthermore, ablation studies validate the efficacy of our framework, highlighting its capacity to optimize performance even with limited annotated samples. Specifically, our framework achieves up to 78.53% performance improvement in Sufficiency@<em>k</em> with just a single annotated sample. Additionally, QTA exhibits strong cross-dataset generalizability, emphasizing its potential for real-world applications.</p>

            <p>Aligning the output of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences (e.g., by means of reinforcement learning with human feedback, or RLHF) is essential for ensuring their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Despite significant advancements in LLM alignment techniques, the impact of different type of preference data on model performance has yet to be systematically explored. In this study, we investigate the scalability, data efficiency, and effectiveness of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs, aiming to reduce their dependency on extensive amounts of preference data, which is expensive to collect. We (1) systematically compare the performance of models fine-tuned with varying percentages of a combined preference judgement dataset to define the improvement curve of DPO and assess its effectiveness in data-constrained environments; and (2) provide insights for the development of an optimal approach for selective preference data usage. Our study reveals that increasing the amount of data used for training generally enhances and stabilizes model performance. Moreover, the use of a combination of diverse datasets significantly improves model effectiveness. Furthermore, when models are trained separately using different types of prompts, models trained with conversational prompts outperformed those trained with question answering prompts.</p>

            <p>Shopping in Virtual Reality (VR) contains numerous advantages, such as detailed product diagnosticity and virtually unlimited store space. It also provides superior hedonic features compared to traditional online shopping. However, Recommender Systems (RSs), which are commonly used to assist users in finding preferred products in online shopping, have not yet been extensively researched in VR shopping. It is crucial to understand how users experience RSs and perceive the recommendation results within VR stores. To address the research gaps, we compared three presentation methods (Arrow, Highlight, Swap) with varying levels of perceptibility for an RS in VR shopping. A within-subject study (N=14) revealed that the methods with higher perceptibility enhanced user experiences, reduced perceived workload, and garnered more preferences. Additionally, we examined the effects of these presentation designs on sense of agency and trust in RS, with a focus on the interaction between trust and users' prior trust.

            <p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across various natural language processing tasks and are increasingly integrated into daily life. Just as personality traits are crucial in human communication, they could also play a significant role in the behavior of LLMs, for instance, in the context of Retrieval Augmented Generation. Previous studies have shown that Big Five personality traits could be applied to LLMs, but their specific effects on information retrieval tasks have not been sufficiently explored. This study aims to examine how personality traits assigned to LLM agents affect their query formulation behavior and search performance. We propose a method to accurately assign personality traits to LLM agents based on the Big Five theory and verify its accuracy using the IPIP-NEO-120 scale. We then design a query generation experiment using the NTCIR Ad-Hoc test collections and evaluate the search performance of queries generated by different LLM agents. The results show that our method successfully assigns all five personality traits to LLM agents as intended. Additionally, the query generation experiment suggests that the assigned traits did influence the length and vocabulary choices of generated queries. Finally, the retrieval effectiveness of the traits varied across test collections, showing a relative improvement ranging from -7.7% to +4.6%, but these differences were not statistically significant.</p>

            <p>The emergence of Vec2Text --- a method for text embedding inversion --- has raised serious privacy concerns for dense retrieval systems which use text embeddings, such as those offered by OpenAI and Cohere. This threat comes from the ability for a malicious attacker with access to embeddings to reconstruct the original text. In this paper, we investigate various factors related to embedding models that may impact text recoverability via Vec2Text. We explore factors such as distance metrics, pooling functions, bottleneck pre-training, training with noise addition, embedding quantization, and embedding dimensions, which were not considered in the original Vec2Text paper. Through a comprehensive analysis of these factors, our objective is to gain a deeper understanding of the key elements that affect the trade-offs between the text recoverability and retrieval effectiveness of dense retrieval systems, offering insights for practitioners designing privacy-aware dense retrieval systems. We also propose a simple embedding transformation fix that guarantees equal ranking effectiveness while mitigating the recoverability risk. Overall, this study reveals that Vec2Text could pose a threat to current dense retrieval systems, but there are some effective methods to patch such systems.</p>

            <p>Considering query variance in information retrieval (IR) experiments is beneficial for retrieval effectiveness. Especially ranking ensembles based on different topically related queries retrieve better results than rankings based on a single query alone. Recently, generative instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) improved on a variety of different tasks in capturing human language. To this end, this work explores the feasibility of using synthetic query variants generated by instruction-tuned LLMs in data fusion experiments. More specifically, we introduce a lightweight, unsupervised, and cost-efficient approach that exploits principled prompting and data fusion techniques. In our experiments, LLMs produce more effective queries when provided with additional context information on the topic. Furthermore, our analysis based on four TREC newswire benchmarks shows that data fusion based on synthetic query variants is significantly better than baselines with single queries and also outperforms pseudo-relevance feedback methods.

These candidate unanswerable questions are evaluated using advanced MRC models to ensure their context-based unanswerability, with the final selection based on a majority consensus mechanism. Our approach addresses the scarcity of multi-labeled datasets like SQuAD2-CR, enabling comprehensive evaluation of MRC systems' ability to handle unanswerable queries and facilitating the exploration of solutions such as query reformulation.

            <p>Understanding how and why people interact with information through search interfaces is central to Interactive Information Retrieval (IIR). Research has demonstrated that cognitive biases significantly influence search behavior and outcomes.

However, they also have the potential to be more constrained, directed and biased. This shift raises important questions about how these advanced, generative and conversational interfaces will affect user behaviours in light of their cognitive biases. This tutorial aims to engage participants in designing experiments to investigate the impact of cognitive biases in the emerging area of Generative IIR (GenIIR). The tutorial is structured into two main sessions. The first half-day will provide an overview of existing research on cognitive biases in information retrieval. We will then explore how advancements in GenIIR create both challenges and opportunities for studying these biases. This foundation will lead into the hands-on segment of the tutorial.

            <p>Retrieval-enhanced machine learning (REML) refers to the use of information retrieval methods to support reasoning and inference in machine learning tasks. Although relatively recent, these approaches can substantially improve model performance. This includes improved generalization, knowledge grounding, scalability, freshness, attribution, interpretability and on-device learning. To date, despite being influenced by work in the information retrieval community, REML research has predominantly been presented in natural language processing (NLP) conferences. Our tutorial addresses this disconnect by introducing core REML concepts and synthesizing the literature from various domains in machine learning (ML), including, but beyond NLP. What is unique to our approach is that we used consistent notations, to provide researchers with a unified and expandable framework. The tutorial will be presented in lecture format based on an existing manuscript, with supporting materials and a comprehensive reading list available at https://retrieval-enhanced-ml.github.io/SIGIR-AP2024-tutorial.</p>

            <p>Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) techniques use neural machinery to represent queries and documents as learned bags of words. In contrast with other neural retrieval techniques, such as generative retrieval and dense retrieval, LSR has been shown to be a remarkably robust, transferable, and efficient family of methods for retrieving high-quality search results. This half-day tutorial aims to provide an extensive overview of LSR, ranging from its fundamentals to the latest emerging techniques. By the end of the tutorial, attendees will be familiar with the important design decisions of an LSR system, know how to apply them to text and other modalities, and understand the latest techniques for retrieving with them efficiently.

            <p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has gained wide attention as the key component to improve generative models with external knowledge augmentation from information retrieval. It has shown great prominence in enhancing the functionality and performance of large language model (LLM)-based applications. However, with the comprehensive application of RAG, more and more problems and limitations have been identified, thus urgently requiring further fundamental exploration to improve current RAG frameworks. This workshop aims to explore in depth how to conduct refined and reliable RAG for downstream AI tasks.</p> <p>To this end, we propose to organize the first R3AG workshop at SIGIR-AP 2024 to call for participants to re-examine and formulate the basic principles and practical implementation of refined and reliable RAG. The workshop serves as a platform for both academia and industry researchers to conduct discussions, share insights, and foster research to build the next generation of RAG systems. Participants will engage in discussions and presentations focusing on fundamental challenges, cutting-edge research, and potential pathways to improve RAG. At the end of the workshop, we aim to have a clearer understanding of how to improve the reliability and applicability of RAG with more robust information retrieval and language generation.</p>

            <p>Evaluation campaigns, where researchers share important tasks, collaboratively develop test collections, and have discussion to advance technologies, are still important events to strategically address core challenges in information access research. The goal of this workshop is to discuss information access tasks that are worth addressing as a community, share new resources and evaluation methodologies, and encourage researchers to ultimately propose new evaluation campaigns in NTCIR, TREC, CLEF, FIRE, etc. The proposed workshop accepts four types of contributions, namely, emerging task, ongoing task, resource, and evaluation papers. The workshop will start with presentation of accepted papers and introduction of ongoing tasks. The rest of the workshop will be run in an interactive manner: round-table discussion on potential tasks.</p>

            <p>Conversational Information Retrieval (CIR) has attracted growing research interest in recent years, particularly since the emergence of conversational agents that leverage generative AI methods. Within the information retrieval community, a substantial body of research has emerged, particularly centred around initiatives such as the TREC CAsT and iKAT tracks. These tracks have been instrumental in providing datasets that facilitate research in CIR and enable a comparative analysis of various approaches to conversational search. Most of the existing efforts within these tracks have concentrated on the interactive dialogue between the searcher and the CIR system. The task has generally overlooked the potential contribution of User modelling for effective CIR. Recognizing the importance of this dimension, the goal of the workshop is to create a collaborative framework for investigating user modelling and its evaluation in the context of CIR. We invite participants to share their insights and proposals regarding User modelling in CIR, particularly in relation to algorithm design, system personalization, and the methods through which these models can be simulated and assessed. By fostering dialogue and collaboration among researchers and practitioners, we aim to deepen our understanding of how effective User modelling might enhance conversational search experiences and lead to more refined and user-centred retrieval systems.
