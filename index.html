It is a the major international forum for the presentation of new research results, and the demonstration of new systems and techniques, in the broad field of information retrieval (IR). The main conference is a two-day event, with tutorial and workshop days before and after the main conference, as required. Other related events, such as CCIR, NTCIR, ADCS, and FIRE may also be scheduled in the days before and after the main conference.</p>

                <p class="mb-4" style="color:black;">
                  Most previous work on outfit recommendation focuses on designing visual features to enhance recommendations. Existing work neglects user comments of fashion items, which have been proved to be effective in generating explanations along with better recommendation results. We propose a novel neural network framework, neural outfit recommendation (NOR), that simultaneously provides outfit recommendations and generates abstractive comments. NOR consists of two parts: outfit matching and comment generation. For outfit matching, we propose a convolutional neural network with a mutual attention mechanism to extract visual features. The visual features are then decoded into a rating score for the matching prediction. For abstractive comment generation, we propose a gated recurrent neural network with a cross-modality attention mechanism to transform visual features into a concise sentence. The two parts are jointly trained based on a multi-task learning framework in an end-to-end back-propagation paradigm. Extensive experiments conducted on an existing dataset and a collected real-world dataset show NOR achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines for outfit recommendation

                <p class="mb-4" style="color:black;">
                  Many application problems can be formalized as matching between two sets of objects or two sequences of objects. Examples of the former include user-item matching in recommendation, and examples of the latter include query-title matching in search. Although matching techniques have been widely used in practice, it still lacks a thorough study from a general viewpoint. In this talk, I will give an overview of matching technologies, particularly those used in search and recommendation.  I will describe a formulation of the matching problem, summarize the major concepts with regard to matching, and make comparison between matching and other tasks. I will propose several principles for development of matching technologies.  I will also introduce related work at the AI Lab of Bytedance Technology.

                  Abstract: Nowadays, automatic human-computer conversational systems have attracted great attention from both industry and academia. Intelligent products such as XiaoIce (by Microsoft) have been released, while tons of Artificial Intelligence companies have been established. We see that the technology behind the conversational systems is accumulating and now open to the public gradually. With the investigation of researchers, conversational systems are more than scientific fictions: they become real. It would be interesting to review the recent development of human-computer conversational systems, especially the significant changes brought by deep learning techniques.

                <p class="mb-4" style="color:black;">
                  Abstract: In this talk, we will describe the journey of building a semantic matching engine for helping customers effortlessly search and shop at Amazon. We will present various experiments of using neural networks to compute the semantic similarity between a query and product, represented as a combination of text and behavioral features (such as review rating, number of reviews, sales, etc.). We will report results from various neural architectures, loss functions, training data, and tokenization methods including strategies for handling novel queries. Overall, we are going to share some learnings from training a neural network-based information retrieval engine that significantly improved offline metrics, customer experience and key business metrics. The talk closes with a description of the challenges that require further innovation in science and engineering to build a deep learning-based semantic search engine.

Towards this goal, in-person attendees will be encouraged to purchase carbon credits matching their transport costs, and all conference purchases will either be undertaken via approved green suppliers, or be matched by the purchase of carbon credits as part of the conference budget.

                      Online attendance fees will be set at a level sufficiently low to be viable to interested people from all countries. Where even those fees would prove onerous to individuals, online attendance at the conference will be made available free of charge.
